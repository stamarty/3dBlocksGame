# 3dBlocksGame
Complete 3d block dodging game. Built in **Unity**.

This game compiles and runs in the **Unity IDE**, but there is no .exe associated with it. Since this was my first foray into game making with
Unity, I mostly followed Brackey's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL) from 
[YouTube](www.youtube.com).

## Skills practiced

- Object creation
- Movement
- Collision
- C# Scripting
- Scene development
- Scene transitioning
- Main menu/Credits scene

This was a very exciting tutorial for me to work through as it worked through the installation and deployment of the Unity IDE and some of the 
basics associated with game development. 

Next step is to create a **2d game**. I'll likely follow another tutorial before I set out to make one on my own.
